# VPG
A VPG implementation using Pytorch. Works on Gymnasium. ~Very slow and inefficient.~

Now somewhat fast. (I made it faster just by changing float64 into float32 and only updating parameters only after a few steps ðŸ˜…)

More to add:

Support for continuous action spaces

Adding a CNNPolicy

Trying to add a RNNLayer
